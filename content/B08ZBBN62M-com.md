- This 511-piece set makes a great holiday or birthday gift for kids aged 7+ who love animals. It’s ideal for immersive solo play and will keep youngsters and their friends entertained for hours
- The riding center measures over 10 in. (26 cm) high, 8 in. (22 cm) wide and 4 in. (12 cm) deep – small enough to keep out on display so kids can dip in and out of the fun nature play
- Let kids channel their love of creatures into creative play with the LEGO Friends Forest Horseback Riding Center (41683), where they can care for animals, explore nature and hang with friends
- The 3-story ranch has a stable downstairs with a kitchen, bedroom and dining area above. Outside, kids can put the dog to bed in its kennel then toast marshmallows on the campfire
