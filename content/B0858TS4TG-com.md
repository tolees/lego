- This module measures over 7‚Äù (18.5cm) high, 14.5‚Äù (38cm) wide and 12.5‚Äù (32cm) deep in its basic formation and can be rebuilt and combined with the Starter Course and other Expansion Sets in multiple ways
- The player must choose their own route for LEGO Mario (figure not included), defeating either the Bob-omb, Koopa Troopa or Piranha Plant toy figures, before landing on the POW Block to open the fortress door
- Kids can build another exciting level to add to their LEGO Super Mario Adventures with Mario Starter Course and compete against friends with this Guarded Fortress Expansion Set 71362
- This 468-piece, collectible, creative LEGO toy makes a fun birthday or holiday gift for kids aged 8 and up to add to their Adventures with Mario Starter Course 71360, inspiring them to build their own unique levels
