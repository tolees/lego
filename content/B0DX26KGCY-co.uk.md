ℹ️:

- GAME CHANGING CHALLENGES: Add the 20 optional challenge cards and players might have to; build with their eyes closed, with one hand or with a silent INSTRUCTOR… it’s not so easy now!
- RIDICULOUSLY FUN CHALLENGES: Work together in teams of two to build abstract miniature LEGO models, the fastest and most accurate team takes maximum points, so try to keep your cool!
- CONSTRUCTION CHAOS: It’s a race so everyone builds at the same time! There are 92 LEGO models to build plus 20 game-changing challenge cards, so, you’ll never know what or how you’ll build next!
- BUILD, BUILD, BUILD: The rules are so simple, players will be building in no time! Teammates swap roles of BUILDER and INSTRUCTOR for each round… so expect frantically fun crossed-wires galore and plenty of fun!
- TICK TOCK: This game is seriously fast! Teams race to build models but there’s no hanging around for last place… when the first team finishes everyone has just 30 seconds to complete their builds.
