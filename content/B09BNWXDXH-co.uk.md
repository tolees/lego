‚ÑπÔ∏è:

- The 2-sided LEGO Technic RC vehicle can be flipped by hand to reveal a tracked racer on one side & an exploration truck toy on the other side
- 2 shock absorbers drive the ‚Äòpop-up‚Äô function that changes the shape of the LEGO remote control car toy when it flips over
- The transforming remote control flipping car toy makes a top Christmas gift idea for 9 plus year old boys and girls interested in engineering
- Models feature suspension, cockpits and tracks, 2 large motors, 1 hub & a truck bed on the exploration truck for kids to explore as they play
- Use the CONTROL+ App to steer the 2 in 1 model - the app automatically switches screens to match the vehicle when the model flips
- Both transforming RC remote control flip cars have bogie suspension, which allows the model cars tracks to adapt to uneven surfaces
- Features a LEGO Technic app-controlled transformation vehicle, the first LEGO Technic set to flip over when the vehicle hits a wall
